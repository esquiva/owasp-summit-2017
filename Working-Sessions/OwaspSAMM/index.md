We organise several [OWASP SAMM](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project) Working-Sessions as part of the OWASP summit.

The SAMM Summit is not a regular conference with speaking slots, but a summit where the participants work together in a 5-day sprint on SAMMv2. If you are interested to contribute to this, you are most welcome (knowledge of SAMM or other secure development methodology experience is a prerequisite).

This is an excellent opportunity to influence the direction of SAMM and exchange experiences with your peers.

## Objectives
Main objectives for the 2017 SAMM Summit are:

1. Draft SAMM2, the "DevOps release"
2. Assure SAMM leverages other OWASP projects as part of the SAMM practices
